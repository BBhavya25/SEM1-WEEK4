console.log("History:");
console.log(
  "JavaScript was developed in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications. Originally called Mocha, then LiveScript, it was renamed to JavaScript for marketing purposes. JavaScript was standardized as ECMAScript in 1997, ensuring cross-browser compatibility.Initially created in just 10 days, it was originally called Mocha, then renamed LiveScript, and finally JavaScript as a marketing strategy to align with the popularity of Java at the time. JavaScript became popular for its ability to create interactive and dynamic elements on web pages, distinguishing itself from static HTML. In 1996, JavaScript was adopted by Microsoft, and they released a similar scripting language called JScript, enabling cross-browser compatibility issues that continued for years. In 1997, JavaScript became an official standard through ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) as ECMAScript, ensuring its consistent implementation across different browsers.\n"

console.log("Purpose:");
console.log(
  "JavaScript was designed to make web pages interactive. It enables features like form validation, animations, and dynamic content without requiring a page refresh. Today, it's used across front-end, back-end, mobile, and desktop development.Unlike traditional server-side languages that require a page refresh to show changes, JavaScript operates on the client side, allowing for real-time interactivity without reloading. Today, JavaScript's use has expanded to backend development (through Node.js), mobile development, and even desktop applications, making it a full-fledged, multipurpose language.\n"

console.log("Where It Runs:");
console.log(
  "JavaScript primarily runs in the browser, interacting with the DOM to update HTML and CSS in real time. It can also run on servers with Node.js, making it a versatile language for both front-end and back-end development. Browsers come with JavaScript engines (like V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, and Chakra in Edge) that execute JavaScript code, enabling it to handle user inputs, make API requests, and control web page behavior dynamically. On the server side, JavaScript can run through Node.js, a runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable applications using JavaScript as a backend language. This versatility enables JavaScript to play a central role in the web environment, where it powers both front-end and back-end development."
